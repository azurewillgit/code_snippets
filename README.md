# code_snippets
Code snippets I use in my instagram posts for you to download and try yourself!

Here you can find and try out my .py files to run locally. Usually I add a lot more details as comments in the files itself. 

All you need to do is download the file (or copy the contents into your editor) and execute it. I recommend PyCharm or Sublime Text.

Feel free to contact me if there are any questions!
